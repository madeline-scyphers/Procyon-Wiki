[[Characters/Kit Apple|Kit]] brings [[Characters/Flora|Flora]] to the banquet, where [[Characters/Kit Apple|Kit]] and their parent have a heated discussion until Kit breaksdown a little and just wants to hide. Rocco softens, feels bad, checks in with their kid, and tries to do better, understanding that the blue suit they sent wasn't the right clothes and next time they will try and make fancy blue overalls for Kit instead.
