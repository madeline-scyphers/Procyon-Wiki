Known throughout [Procyon](../index.md) by its nickname “Glimmer,” the surface of this enormous planet is made of carbon compounds such as graphite and diamond. At night, the largest crystal formations glow with unearthly light—a property many of the crystals retain after being cut. One must dock at Guild station IA-23 in orbit and shuttle down to do business on the surface.

Special Rule

Vosian crystals are prized by Guilds and mystics alike. Vos is full of money, but also closely monitored by the Guild. When you do a job on Vos, you earn +1 cred and +1 heat.

Well-armed, permanent blockade in space, with ships waiting for clearance. Smooth walls of dense carbon brick, windows looking out onto the black surface. Diamondscarred and sooty-faced miners, drinking with shaking hands by their bulky sonic cutters. Pristine shops of the visitor settlement.
