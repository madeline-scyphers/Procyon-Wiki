This desert planet is ravaged by electrical storms that occasionally clear colored sand off mineral deposits essential to space travel, or turn it to glass, giving a view to the ruins beneath. Teams race to capitalize on these events. There is a substantial civilian population, including the sectorâ€™s preeminent educational institution, Khalud Academy.

Special Rule

Although only students and professors are technically allowed to use the Khalud Academy archives, any study rolls while using them take +1d.

Professors walking down the marble paths of the Academy. A market street with insistent vendors selling sandworm kebabs to hungry miners. Excavators packing furiously onto sand-skiffs, ready to take advantage of a stormcleared deposit. The storm alert blaring citywide.
