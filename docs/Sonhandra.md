This planet is tidally locked—the same side of the planet faces the star at all times. The day side is blistering. Oddly, all light sources extinguish about a kilometer into the night side. Most of the settlements are in the twilight border zone, including the capital of Ugar. Known for its lax policies regulating trade, it’s become a choice destination for smugglers and fences alike. 

Special Rule

Everything is available on Sonhandra for a price. You can always take +1d to acquire assets, but on a 1-3 roll the asset also comes with strings (even if you boost the result with cred). 

# Vibe

---

Perpetual twilight amid paved streets and concrete buildings. Howling of frequent wind storms between the two regions. Masked and cloaked strangers congregating around a steel warehouse before an auction begins. Row after row of ships parked in the open dirt on the outskirts of Ugar.
