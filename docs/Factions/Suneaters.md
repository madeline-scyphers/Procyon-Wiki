## Tier

4

## Location

[Lithios](../Procyon/Iota/Lithios.md.md#.md#),[Nightfall](../Procyon/Brekk/Nightfall.md)

## Nature
Ur-archaeologists obsessed with recreating jumpgate technology. Currently looking to extinguish a star in pursuit of their larger goals.

## Turf
An Ur ruin on [Lithios](../Procyon/Iota/Lithios.md) (HQ). Several [Nightfall](../Procyon/Brekk/Nightfall.md)-based warehouses.

## Notable NPCs
- Elil (astrophysicist, fanatic, brilliant).
- Ruba (archaeologist, mystic, seer).
- Racel (engineer, loyal, conflicted).
- Rygar Z’tann (mystic, guard, gravity bender).

## Notable Assets
- A few well-armed, unmarked ships.
- Armed troops.
- Mystics painfully trained to Way-bend gravity.
- Parts to build a jumpgate with activated Ur beacon.
- Solar siphon.

## Quirks
Suneaters spend most of their days handling Ur artifacts and have all learned how to handle them safely.

## Allies
- [Ghosts](./Ghosts.md)

## Enemies
- Sah’iir

## Situation
Many are ex-Guilders or mystics, who have poured decades of money and study into their cause. If successful in their mission to mine [Iota](../Procyon/Iota/index.md)-2 for energy, the Hegemon would instantly grant the Suneaters Guild status, even if everyone in [Iota](../Procyon/Iota/index.md) perishes. The Suneaters consider it worth the risk.
