Becoming a Vigilance member means receiving an artifact blade as a mark of your progress.                                                                                          | Though the Hegemony colonized the sector a hundred years ago, Vigilance was founded thousands of years ago. The current members are all human, since the original practitioners were wiped out when Nim-Amar pacified [Procyon](Procyon/Procyon.md). They have judged the gunrunners and drug makers of [Aketi](Procyon/Brekk/Aketi.md) unworthy.                                                      | <ul><li>Quai-Rosh (elder, mystic, judgmental).</li><li>Aayli Spacerunner (elder, stoic, warrior).</li><li>Ulek Spacedancer (apprentice, rash, friendly).</li></ul>                                                                                                                                                     | <ul><li>Hidden forest temple.</li><li>Temple archives going back to the early days of the Hegemony.</li><li>Mystic tools.</li><li>A handful of powerful mystic warriors.</li></ul>                                                                                      |
