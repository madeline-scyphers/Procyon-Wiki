## Tier

2

## Location

[Amerath](../Procyon/Iota/Amerath.md)

## Nature
Also known as the Makers Guild, they grow clones for menial labor that are supposedly short-lived and only barely sentient.

## Turf
Sanctioned Yaru creche on Lithios (HQ). Secret research facility on [Amerath](../Procyon/Iota/Amerath.md).

## Notable NPCs
- Foler Atherton (biologist, concealed).
- Bal Yn (geneticist, haughty).
- Rech (savant, cold). All unmarked progenitor clones.

## Notable Assets
- Cloning facilities.
- Clones placed in several important households and facilities, which report back.
- Powerful capacity for genetic manipulation.

## Quirks
The Makers Guild doesn't accept new members. The progenitors have self-perfected and are frozen; only so many are allowed to be active at once. The Yaru (as the clones are called) make many people in their presence uneasy.

## Allies
- [Lost Legion](./Lost%20Legion.md)

## Enemies
- [Cobalt Syndicate](./Cobalt%20Syndicate.md)

## Situation
When the Hegemon ascended, the Yaru sided with a competitor, and their numbers, strictly regulated by the Hegemon, have been severely reduced. Unsatisfied, they have thrown in with the [Lost Legion](./Lost%20Legion.md), and are secretly working to restore the previous Hegemon to power.
