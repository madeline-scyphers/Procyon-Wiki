notable npcs:
  - Foler Atherton (biologist, concealed).
  - Bal Yn (geneticist, haughty).
  - Rech (savant, cold). All unmarked progenitor clones.
turf: Sanctioned Yaru creche on Lithios (HQ). Secret research facility on [Amerath](Procyon/Iota/Amerath.md).
quirks: The Makers Guild doesn't accept new members. The progenitors have self-perfected and are frozen; only so many are allowed to be active at once. The Yaru (as the clones are called) make many people in their presence uneasy.
situation: When the Hegemon ascended, the Yaru sided with a competitor, and their numbers, strictly regulated by the Hegemon, have been severely reduced. Unsatisfied, they have thrown in with the [Lost Legion](Factions/Lost%20Legion.md), and are secretly working to restore the previous Hegemon to power.
