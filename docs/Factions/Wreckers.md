## Tier
1

## Nature
Scavengers, thieves, and hackers who incite [[./index|Factions]] to fight so that they may pick the battlefields clean later.

## Turf
Makeshift base inside a derelict ship near Baftoma (HQ).

## Notable NPCs
- Bobby-O (wizard-class hacker, arrogant, trickster).
- Meshkilarn (mechanic, muscled, grimy).
- Qord (xeno, thief, delicate, one-handed).

## Notable Assets
- A series of fake transponders, booby traps, and mock ships used to lure in unsuspecting marks.
- The Derelict-8, a derelict frigate they found after a battle between Draxler’s Raiders and the Legion.

## Quirks
Wreckers pick members from folks already fleeing from someone or hiding in Baftoma. They often trade air and water as a means of scoping folks out.

## Allies
- [[./Borniko Syndicate|Borniko Syndicate]]

## Enemies
- Draxler’s Raiders
- [[./Echo Wave Riders|Echo Wave Riders]]

## Situation
The crew has hit several targets in the system by sowing confusion between the [[../Atlas/Procyon/Rin/index|Rin]] [[./index|Factions]], and cleaning up after pirates. Their goal is to salvage enough to repair their current home, the ship they call the Derelict-8. To do that, many more ships are going to need to be destroyed.
