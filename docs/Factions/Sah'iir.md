## Nature
Tall, fully robed xenos who travel with blindfolded servants that speak for them. Gave the Hegemony the ansible network.

## Turf
The Sah'iir Embassy, recently purchased on [[../Procyon/Rin/Warren|Warren]] (HQ). Workstations at every ansible network point.

## Notable NPCs
- Ren 3-Meti (matriarch, xeno, cunning, commanding).
- Iisoo 7-Chim (trader, explorer, xeno, humanitarian).
- Wi 13-Meti (Renâ€™s clutchmate, xeno, ambitious, underhanded, marked).

## Goals
Find the Ur ansible.

## Notable Assets
- A fleet of black metal merchant ships.
- Private ansible networks.
- Extensive funds from trading.

## Quirks
The Sah'iir communicate via special hosts they control called Echoes. Each may have up to a dozen of such Echoes. It's said they sense who is suitable to be their Echo regardless of distance.

## Allies
- [[./Counters Guild|Counters Guild]]

## Enemies
- [[./Guild of Engineers|Guild of Engineers]]
- [[./Suneaters|Suneaters]]

## Situation
The Sah'iir have earned their place by being too important to the Hegemony to get rid of. While not technically a Guild, they guard the secrets of ansibles as if they were one. They have detected a signal from [[../Procyon/index|Procyon]] when a Precursor ansible was activated and have come to investigate.
