## Tier

1

## Location

[Sonhandra](../Procyon/Holt/Sonhandra.md)

## Nature

Fourth and fifth children, these young Nobles have taken an oath sanctified by the Hegemon to seek the Light of the World.

## Turf

None. Knights travel on private vessels. The Grail (a bar on [Sonhandra](../Procyon/Holt/Sonhandra.md) is where they leave messages for each other.

## Notable NPCs

- [Nicols al’Nim-Amar](Nicols%20al%E2%80%99Nim-Amar.md) (leader, glib, hopeful).
- [Al’Vorron](Al%E2%80%99Vorron.md) (priestess, renowned, bejeweled).
- [Junrai](Junrai.md) (explorer, death wish, restless).
- [Intal Brel](Intal%20Brel.md) (religious, vigilant, honorable).


## Goals

Find the first Ur site on their map.

## Notable Assets

- A map of [Procyon](../Procyon/index.md) from before the Hegemony.
- Exploration ships.
- Significant personal power and funds.


## Quirks

Each Knight is as distinct as they can be from each other. This tight-knit group is comprised of unique, colorful characters.

## Allies

- [Mendicants](./Mendicants.md).
- [Vigilance](./Vigilance.md).


## Enemies

- [Acolytes of Brashkadesh](./Acolytes%20of%20Brashkadesh.md).


## Situation

A retrieved message about a powerful artifact that could terraform previously dead worlds ignited a fervor in a number of Hegemonic youths. Taking an oath blessed by the Hegemon to find it, they're looking all over the Galaxy. Nicols recently found a marked map of [Procyon](../Procyon/index.md) predating the Hegemony.
