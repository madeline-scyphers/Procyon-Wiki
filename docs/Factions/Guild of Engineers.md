## Situation

Decadent and powerful, the Guild of Engineers is beyond the [Governor](../Characters/Governor%20Ritam%20al%E2%80%99Malklaith.md)'s ability to police. They are exploiting this remote sector to perform experiments banned by the Cults and the Hegemon. Their current project involves converting Way energy into a highly unstable but physical compound.
