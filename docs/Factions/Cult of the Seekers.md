Wandering mystics studying artifacts and exploring, looking to open the Hantu gate. Members include the Hegemon’s mother.

## Goals

Open the Hantu gate.

## Notable Assets

- A large stockpile of artifacts.


## Quirks

Many of the Cult are young ex-Legionnaires that have been personally drafted by the Hegemon’s mother and inspired by the cause.

## Allies

## Situation

The Seekers believe they have a holy imperative to expand the Hegemony to the farthest reaches of space. Having found a lead on [Shimaya](../Procyon/Brekk/Shimaya.md), they’ve set up a dig site that promises to unearth at least some of the missing pieces of the Hantu gate.
