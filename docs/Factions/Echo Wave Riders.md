## Tier

2

## Nature

Pilots that organize illegal races, take mercenary work, or test dangerous new engine/flight technologies for the Guilds.

## Turf

A secluded hangar on [Nightfall](../Procyon/Brekk/Nightfall.md).

## Notable NPCs

- [Garge Ztar](Garge%20Ztar.md) (risk-taker, ambitious, charismatic).
- [Elen](Elen.md) (engineer, analytical, race-winner).
- [Inofra](Inofra.md) (stunt pilot, compassionate, veteran).
- [Dom](Dom.md) (ex-Starsmith mechanic, genius, family man, lives to race).


## Goals

Organize a system-wide race in [Brekk](../Procyon/Brekk/index.md).

## Notable Assets

- A host of ships of their own and access to far more.
- Substantial mechanical facilities on [Nightfall](../Procyon/Brekk/Nightfall.md).


## Quirks

Echo Wave Riders don’t respect those who don’t know how to pilot their own ship and settle all scores with races.

## Allies

- [Borniko Syndicate](./Borniko%20Syndicate.md).
- [Starsmiths Guild](./Starsmiths%20Guild.md).


## Enemies

- [Wreckers](./Wreckers.md).


## Situation

The Riders are left alone by authorities if their races are kept far enough from civilization—and claiming Bright Wind takes care of that. They plan to put on an epic race among system pilots for prestige and cash.
