## Tier

4

## Location

[Warren](../Procyon/Rin/Warren.md),[Procyon](../Procyon/index.md.md#)

## Nature
Although they often hire themselves out as bounty hunters, the Scarlet Wolves are a renowned group of assassins.

## Turf
The Killroom, a high-end safe house on [Warren](../Procyon/Rin/Warren.md) (HQ). Holdouts on most planets.

## Notable NPCs
- Rik “Old Wolf” Urus (leader, dangerous, retired, cunning).
- Hara “Mamba” M’brozz (sniper, killer, thrill-seeker).
- Jet “Shark” Wolffe (aloof, confident, unforgiving).

## Goals
Murder top [Guild of Engineers](./Guild%20of%20Engineers.md) officials.

## Notable Assets
- A large armory of the very best weapons.
- An actual huge wolf genetically engineered by the [Yaru](./Yaru.md) as payment. (Rik keeps it. They feed it others who don’t pay.)

## Quirks
Each member of the Wolves bears a distinctive tattoo of a wolf holding a star in its mouth.

## Allies
None. With the Wolves, it’s strictly business.

## Enemies
- [Starless Veil](./Starless%20Veil.md)

## Situation
The Scarlet Wolves are contract killers specializing in hard targets. They have a reputation for delivering, minimizing collateral, and never taking bribes. They’ve taken a large contract from the [Counters Guild](./Counters%20Guild.md) to kill a number of the [Guild of Engineers](./Guild%20of%20Engineers.md)’ heads but need time to set up the hit.
