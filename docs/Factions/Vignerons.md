## Situation
The Vignerons distill life essence from living victims and use it to extend their own lives. With this technology, their founders have lived for hundreds of years. Owing to its highly illegal nature, the Vignerons operate in secret, augmenting themselves and manipulating people behind the scenes. They wish to grow, converting a number of superior bodies to their cause.
