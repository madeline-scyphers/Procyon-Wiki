## Tier

3

## Location

[[../Procyon/Brekk/index|Brekk]]

## Nature
A notorious prison in [[../Procyon/index|Procyon]] housing the worst offenders. Brokers commutations for those with power and wealth.

## Turf
Isotropa Max Secure in [[../Procyon/Brekk/index|Brekk]] (HQ).

## Notable NPCs
- [[Bafma F’rozz|Bafma F’rozz]] (warden, haughty, confident, wealthy).
- [[Kreel|Kreel]] (guard captain, muscled, angry).
- [[Dr. Xhu|Dr. Xhu]] (psychotherapist, corrupt, gambler).

## Goals
Get more prisoners (repeat).

## Notable Assets
- The biggest supermax prison in [[../Procyon/index|Procyon]].
- An organized file of dirt on anyone they do business with.

## Quirks
The staff of Isotropa are all corrupt and will take bribes for almost anything.

## Allies
- [[./Guild of Engineers|Guild of Engineers]].

## Enemies
- Draxler’s Raiders.

## Situation
Between the Warden’s excessive spending habits, Dr. Xhu’s gambling problem, and Kreel’s "educating" the prisoners, Isotropa always needs more funds and bodies. The prison spends a lot of time lobbying local planetary Governors to increase sentencing or acquiring “special guests” from [[./index|Factions]] and just as much time looking for bribes.
