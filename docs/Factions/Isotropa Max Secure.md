## Tier

3

## Location

[Brekk](../Procyon/Brekk/index.md)

## Nature
A notorious prison in [Procyon](../Procyon/index.md) housing the worst offenders. Brokers commutations for those with power and wealth.

## Turf
Isotropa Max Secure in [Brekk](../Procyon/Brekk/index.md) (HQ).

## Notable NPCs
- [Bafma F’rozz](Bafma%20F%E2%80%99rozz.md) (warden, haughty, confident, wealthy).
- [Kreel](Kreel.md) (guard captain, muscled, angry).
- [Dr. Xhu](Dr.%20Xhu.md) (psychotherapist, corrupt, gambler).

## Goals
Get more prisoners (repeat).

## Notable Assets
- The biggest supermax prison in [Procyon](../Procyon/index.md).
- An organized file of dirt on anyone they do business with.

## Quirks
The staff of Isotropa are all corrupt and will take bribes for almost anything.

## Allies
- [Guild of Engineers](./Guild%20of%20Engineers.md).

## Enemies
- Draxler’s Raiders.

## Situation
Between the Warden’s excessive spending habits, Dr. Xhu’s gambling problem, and Kreel’s "educating" the prisoners, Isotropa always needs more funds and bodies. The prison spends a lot of time lobbying local planetary Governors to increase sentencing or acquiring “special guests” from [Factions](./index.md) and just as much time looking for bribes.
