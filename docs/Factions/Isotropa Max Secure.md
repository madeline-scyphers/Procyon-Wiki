## Tier
3

## Nature
A notorious prison in [[Procyon|Procyon]] housing the worst offenders. Brokers commutations for those with power and wealth.

## Turf
Isotropa Max Secure in [[Brekk|Brekk]] (HQ).

## Notable NPCs
- Bafma F’rozz (warden, haughty, confident, wealthy).
- Kreel (guard captain, muscled, angry).
- Dr. Xhu (psychotherapist, corrupt, gambler).

## Goals
Get more prisoners (repeat).

## Notable Assets
- The biggest supermax prison in [[Procyon|Procyon]].
- An organized file of dirt on anyone they do business with.

## Quirks
The staff of Isotropa are all corrupt and will take bribes for almost anything.

## Allies
- [[Guild of Engineers|Guild of Engineers]].

## Enemies
- Draxler’s Raiders.

## Situation
Between the Warden’s excessive spending habits, Dr. Xhu’s gambling problem, and Kreel’s "educating" the prisoners, Isotropa always needs more funds and bodies. The prison spends a lot of time lobbying local planetary Governors to increase sentencing or acquiring “special guests” from [[Factions|Factions]] and just as much time looking for bribes.
