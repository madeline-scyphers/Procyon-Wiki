## Notable Assets

## Quirks
Membership into the society is both exclusive and expensive, and considered a mark of taste amongst high society.

## Enemies

## Situation
Focusing on the upper echelon of [Procyon](../Atlas/Procyon/Procyon.md), the Society has traded the typical complications of running drugs for new problems. Their unique drug requires Vosian crystals and [Aketi](../Atlas/Procyon/Brekk/Aketi.md) animals, and with the [Vigilance](./Vigilance.md) harassing their production, they struggle to keep up with demand.
