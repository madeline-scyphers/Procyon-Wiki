## Tier

## Nature
Syndicate-run drug dens masquerading as society houses. Their drugs are cooked with [Aketi](Aketi.md) animal parts and Vosian crystals.

## Turf
The Jewel, a society house on [Mem](Mem.md) (HQ). Wildside, a society house on [Sonhandra](Sonhandra.md). The Mirror Maze, an upscale club on [Warren](Warren.md).

## Notable NPCs
- Madam Gourdan (administrator, charming, connected).
- Pytric (chemist, callous, reclusive).
- Vallis (minor Noble, addicted, wealthy).
- Chorrguth (xeno, hunter, surly).

## Notable Assets
- Vosian crystals and [Aketi](Aketi.md) animals used to produce Haze.
- Several society houses.
- An intrasystem shuttle.

## Quirks
Membership into the society is both exclusive and expensive, and considered a mark of taste amongst high society.

## Allies
- [House Malklaith](House%20Malklaith.md)

## Enemies
- [Vigilance](Vigilance.md)

## Situation
Focusing on the upper echelon of [Procyon](Procyon.md), the Society has traded the typical complications of running drugs for new problems. Their unique drug requires Vosian crystals and [Aketi](Aketi.md) animals, and with the [Vigilance](Vigilance.md) harassing their production, they struggle to keep up with demand.
