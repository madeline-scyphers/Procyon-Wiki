## Nature
Warrior mystics that seek to enforce an ancient code of justice on those they find wanting.

## Turf
The First Temple on [Aketi](Aketi.md) (HQ).

## Notable NPCs
- Quai-Rosh (elder, mystic, judgmental).
- Aayli Spacerunner (elder, stoic, warrior).
- Ulek Spacedancer (apprentice, rash, friendly).

## Notable Assets
- Hidden forest temple.
- Temple archives going back to the early days of the Hegemony.
- Mystic tools.
- A handful of powerful mystic warriors.

## Quirks
Each member is trained by one elder mentor. Becoming a Vigilance member means receiving an artifact blade as a mark of your progress.

## Allies
- [Concordiat Knights](Concordiat%20Knights.md)

## Enemies
- Draxlerâ€™s Raiders
- [Janus Syndicate](Janus%20Syndicate.md)
- [Nightspeakers](Nightspeakers.md)
- [Turner Society](Turner%20Society.md)

## Situation
Though the Hegemony colonized the sector a hundred years ago, Vigilance was founded thousands of years ago. The current members are all human, since the original practitioners were wiped out when Nim-Amar pacified [Procyon](Procyon.md). They have judged the gunrunners and drug makers of [Aketi](Aketi.md) unworthy.
