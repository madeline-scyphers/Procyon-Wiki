- Aayli Spacerunner (elder, stoic, warrior).
- Ulek Spacedancer (apprentice, rash, friendly).

## Notable Assets
- Hidden forest temple.
- Temple archives going back to the early days of the Hegemony.
- Mystic tools.

## Quirks
Each member is trained by one elder mentor. Becoming a Vigilance member means receiving an artifact blade as a mark of your progress.

## Allies
- [[../../Concordiat Knights|Concordiat Knights]]

## Enemies
- Draxlerâ€™s Raiders
- [[../../Janus Syndicate|Janus Syndicate]]
- [[./Nightspeakers|Nightspeakers]]

## Situation
Though the Hegemony colonized the sector a hundred years ago, Vigilance was founded thousands of years ago. The current members are all human, since the original practitioners were wiped out when Nim-Amar pacified [[../Atlas/Procyon/index|Procyon]]. They have judged the gunrunners and drug makers of [[../Atlas/Procyon/Brekk/Aketi|Aketi]] unworthy.
