## Tier

1

## Nature

Mostly young disenfranchised xenos who have turned to crime and found strength and solidarity with each other.

## Turf

Lost Paradise, a club with an attached warehouse where the gang does its business (HQ).

## Notable NPCs

- Dyrinek (xeno, revolutionary, proud).
- Burn (Memish mystic xeno, fast, overconfident, untrained).
- Radds (human, hacker, smart).
- Myrk (xeno, gun enthusiast, hothead).


## Goals

Take over the [Hegemonic News Network](Hegemonic%20News%20Network.md).

## Notable Assets

- A collection of high-end hoverbikes.
- Minor artifacts some of the leaders have attached to themselves.


## Quirks

When a new member joins the gang, they all go out on a drunken tear across the city, leaving a swath of wreckage in their wake.

## Allies

- [Cobalt Syndicate](Cobalt%20Syndicate.md).


## Enemies

- [Hegemonic News Network](Hegemonic%20News%20Network.md).
- [House Malklaith](House%20Malklaith.md).


## Situation

The gang has had run-ins with [System](System.md) police, and the [HNN](Hegemonic%20News%20Network.md) paints them as lowlifes with no future. Dyrinek wants to send a message that they won’t be so easily dismissed and plans to take over the airwaves to broadcast the gang’s punk ideology. All they need is the opportunity.
