## Tier

3

## Location

[Iota](../Procyon/Iota/index.md),[Procyon](../Procyon/index.md.md#)

## Nature
Maintains the Hyperspace lane beacons, jump drives, and jumpgates that make possible the intragalactic Hegemony.

## Turf
[Iota](../Procyon/Iota/index.md) Shipyards (HQ). All major spaceports.

## Notable NPCs
- Dorae White (chief executive, industrious, trustworthy, workaholic).
- Kir M’rikk’lik (technical officer, xeno, gadgeteer, experimenter).
- Nash (operations chief, gruff, overworked).
- Rip Onister (gate expert, curious, shy, reclusive).

## Goals
Find another key for tuning [Rin](../Procyon/Rin/index.md)-[Holt](../Procyon/Holt/index.md).

## Notable Assets
- Jump drives for use in new ships.
- A shipyard.
- Hyperspace lane beacons and charts.
- Trading stations on every route.

## Quirks
All ships in Hegemonic space by law must be registered, certified, and maintained by the Starsmiths Guild. False papers abound, though.

## Allies
- [Cult of the Seekers](./Cult%20of%20the%20Seekers.md)
- [Echo Wave Riders](./Echo%20Wave%20Riders.md)

## Enemies
- [Borniko Syndicate](./Borniko%20Syndicate.md)
- [Cobalt Syndicate](./Cobalt%20Syndicate.md)

## Situation
When the [Rin](../Procyon/Rin/index.md)-[Holt](../Procyon/Holt/index.md) gate was first opened, several Ur artifacts were used to stabilize the connection. The Guild has speculated the gate can go to a second system if another key could be found to retune the gate. The Guild is searching every Ur site they get access to for such a device.
