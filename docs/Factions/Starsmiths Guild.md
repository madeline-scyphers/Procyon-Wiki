## Quirks
All ships in Hegemonic space by law must be registered, certified, and maintained by the Starsmiths Guild. False papers abound, though.

## Situation
When the [[Rin|Rin]]-[[Holt|Holt]] gate was first opened, several Ur artifacts were used to stabilize the connection. The Guild has speculated the gate can go to a second system if another key could be found to retune the gate. The Guild is searching every Ur site they get access to for such a device.
