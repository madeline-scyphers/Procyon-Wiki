## Tier
4

## Nature
The most successful information broker to ever live. Can access any terminal in the sectorâ€”though no one can explain how.

## Turf
An automated [HNN](Hegemonic%20News%20Network.md) satellite orbiting [Warren](Warren.md) (HQ).

## Notable NPCs
- Vorex (wizard-class hacker, stressed, careful, self-modified).
- A-OM (maintenance Urbot, cheerful, non-verbal).
- Tock (security Urbot, protective, staticky, well armed).

## Notable Assets
- An artifact AI core designed to interface with a living being, allowing temporary connection to computers in the same system.
- A massive information network. Dirt on pretty much everyone in the sector.

## Quirks
Few have met Vorex in person; most talk to her through a random terminal or Urbot-delivered message.

## Allies
- None. Vorex is mercenary, but she will help [Conclave 01](Conclave%2001.md) on the cheap.

## Enemies
- [Counters Guild](Counters%20Guild.md)

## Situation
Vorex has been an information broker for years. Using an Ur artifact, she's developed a massive network for buying and selling information. The [Counters Guild](Counters%20Guild.md) kidnapped her sister to make Vorex access the [Guild of Engineers](Guild%20of%20Engineers.md)' network. Vorex seeks to free her sister without tipping her hand.
