Convert an entire factory.

## Notable Assets

An Ur artifact that all the Acolytes have attuned to called the Pillar of Truth.

## Quirks

Attuning to the Pillar allows the Acolytes to communicate with each other and invoke the skills and memories of other Acolytes, who can act through them.

## Allies

- [Mendicants](./Mendicants.md)


## Enemies

- [Ashen Knives](./Ashen%20Knives.md)
- [Guild of Engineers](./Guild%20of%20Engineers.md)


## Situation

The Acolytes are ready to begin the next phase of growing their following, but the Pillar requires massive reserves of energy to keep attuning to more people. They plan to indoctrinate an entire power plant’s workforce, so they can repurpose the plant to power the Pillar of Truth.
