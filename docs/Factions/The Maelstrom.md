## Tier

## Nature
A band of ferocious space pirates hiding among a mysterious nebula and around Baftoma.

## Turf
The Nightbreaker (capital ship HQ), [The Cove](../Procyon/Rin/The%20Cove.md) (made of lashed-together ships), The Ashtari Cloud.

## Notable NPCs
- Alanda “the Banshee” Ryle (Pirate Queen, beautiful, mirthful, risk-taker).
- Yorgar “Thorn” (captain, quiet, calculating, deadly).
- Hunter Black (captain, ex-Noble, daring, space savvy).

## Goals
Seize control of a jumpgate.

## Notable Assets
- The Nightbreaker (a capital ship with a jumpgate inside it).
- Storm drives (engines capable of navigating the Ashtari Cloud).
- A fleet of pirate ships.

## Quirks
The pirates lash together old or damaged ships to make [The Cove](../Procyon/Rin/The%20Cove.md). [The Cove](../Procyon/Rin/The%20Cove.md) is the size of a planetoid rotating near the center of the Ashtari Cloud.

## Allies
- [Ashen Knives](./Ashen%20Knives.md)
- [Cobalt Syndicate](./Cobalt%20Syndicate.md)
- [Nightspeakers](./Nightspeakers.md)

## Enemies
- [51st Legion](./51st%20Legion.md)
- Draxler’s Raiders
- The Guilds
- [House Malklaith](./House%20Malklaith.md)

## Situation
The Maelstrom raids shipping lanes and sells goods via the [Ashen Knives](./Ashen%20Knives.md). Alanda is scheming to find a way to jump systems with her entire crew by taking over a jumpgate, preferably without incurring full-scale Hegemonic retribution.
