The Hegemony is a distant source of law and power. The Hegemon rules from their seat amidst the black holes near the center of the galaxy. The Hegemon’s greatest task is keeping power divided between factions such that they always squabble over it, and don’t unify to seat a new Hegemon. The galaxy is carved into sectors, put under the stewardship of seven Noble Houses. Technology and science are the domain of the approved Hegemonic Guilds (such as the Guild of Engineers). Mysteries and the arcane fall to the approved Hegemonic Cults (such as the Church of Stellar Flame). Each of these guard their domains jealously.

Still, for every rule there is an exception. There are a number of planets that pay a tithe to the Hegemony and self-govern without belonging to any specific House. There are a number of ship repair shops that have mechanics with expired Guild Licenses. There are plenty of mystic groups that walk freely through the streets of every world, and are popular figures of romance and mystery in the entertainment industry—even though they’re not part of any official Hegemonic Cult.
