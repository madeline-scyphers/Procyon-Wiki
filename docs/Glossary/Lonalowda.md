The people of the [[Lona|Lona]], the inhabitants of [[Procyon|Procyon]] before The [[Hegemony|Hegemony]] conquered.

A bastardization of the term from the [[Hegemony|Hegemony]] of Lona is Yona, and the [[Lonalowda|Lonalowda]] called their invaders [[Procy|Procy]], giving us the term Procyona, and eventually [[Procyon|Procyon]].
