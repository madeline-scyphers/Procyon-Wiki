Named for frequent eclipses caused by the planet’s 13 moons. Their erratic movements make night only predictable by computer. The city of Yaw is nestled where night and day last between 2 and 12 hours each. It bustles with economic activity and is a frequent destination for tourists and traders. Known for its haute cuisine and theater.

Special Rule

Nightfall is the center of culture in the system, and everything is mostly about who you know. When you acquire assets, roll with consort instead of crew quality.

# Vibe

---

High-rises lighting up block by block as the city goes from day to night in the span of minutes. A rowdy night club spilling dancers clad in black, glow-accented outfits onto a sun-lit street. The blue glow of a public data kiosk projecting tomorrow’s night schedule and market changes.
