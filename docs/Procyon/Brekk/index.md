Considered by many to be more civilized than the rest of [[../index|Procyon]], this system is home to many finer aspects of the Hegemony—education, art, and culture. Wealth and culture means the Legion presence is strong in the sector. However, there are many odd, non-Starsmithmaintained hyperspace lanes that bend strangely, making long loops perpendicular to planetary orbits. Pilots map these so-called “dark lanes,” making it easy to hide and dodge patrols if one is willing to take one’s time.

# Notable Places

---

## Blackstarr

The vast and largely empty Nightspeaker ship where initiates train for their first year. The ship is unlit and moves routinely to prevent discovery. It does not often receive visitors, but exceptions are made for those that have a favorable relationship to the Cult.

---

## Dendara

An ancient temple on [[./Nightfall|Nightfall]]’s fifth moon, Todav. Some say it’s an Ur temple, others that it’s the remains of a forgotten mystic Cult. Its derelict corridors are tough to tour due to the moon’s lack of atmosphere and the glitching effect it has on drives and electronics.

---

## Bright Wind

A large gas cloud ejected by the star, now used as racing grounds by the [[../../Factions/Echo Wave Riders|Echo Wave Riders]]. Despite it being both lethal and illegal, racers from all over the sector compete for cred and fame. Invitations to the races are exclusive and require qualifying in equally hazardous conditions.

---

## [[../../Factions/Isotropa Max Secure|Isotropa Max Secure]]

Orbiting near the star, Isotropa is the most notorious prison in [[../index|Procyon]]. Wardens broker audiences with prisoners and grant commutations for the powerful and wealthy. They report to Malklaith but the prison largely runs itself.
