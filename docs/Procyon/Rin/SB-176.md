You don’t need a planet in order to mine. Or at least, you don’t need ground. This combination “mining” platform and space colony is responsible for extracting resources from Vet, the gas planet below. The mining rigs in the skies below—mostly manned by Urbots—send their goods to this central hub. Most of those are packaged and fired towards the [[[[Rin|[[Rin]]]-Ecliptis gate.

Special Rule

Engagement rolls on SB-176 itself are always at -1d due to ever-present station monitoring. Any jobs run against Guilders here are considered to be on hostile turf.

# Vibe

---

Cold clacking of footsteps on the brilliantly clean main concourse. Whispers of politicos taking tea at a parlor. Children running down halls, laughing. The hum of generators in the darkened side passages leading to the lower levels. Dingy workers shouting in the cramped quarters of the mining rigs.
