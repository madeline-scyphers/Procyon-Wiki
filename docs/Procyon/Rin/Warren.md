Warren is one of the moons of Aleph and the home to an ecumenopolis—a city spanning the entire surface of the moon. It’s the capitol for the system, and the system [Governor Ritam al’Malklaith](../../Characters/Governor%20Ritam%20al%E2%80%99Malklaith.md) makes his residence here. On Warren, you can find anything you need—for a price. Its high-rises are full of legitimate business dealings, and its streets far less so.

Special Rule

Warren is a wretched hive of villainy, yet also the Hegemonic seat of power in the system. You can take +1d to acquire assets here, if you also accept +2 heat.

Socialites attending a gala at the [Governor](../../Characters/Governor%20Ritam%20al%E2%80%99Malklaith.md)’s mansion.
