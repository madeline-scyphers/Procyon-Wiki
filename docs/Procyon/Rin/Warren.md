Warren is one of the moons of Aleph and the home to an ecumenopolis—a city spanning the entire surface of the moon. It’s the capitol for the system, and the system [[Characters/Governor Ritam al’Malklaith|Governor Ritam al’Malklaith]] makes his residence here. On Warren, you can find anything you need—for a price. Its high-rises are full of legitimate business dealings, and its streets far less so.

Special Rule

Warren is a wretched hive of villainy, yet also the Hegemonic seat of power in the system. You can take +1d to acquire assets here, if you also accept +2 heat.

# Vibe

A bustling street market with neon signs promising foods of all kinds in several languages. Hovercars streaming between towering buildings. The bass beat of a basement club playing the latest mix; patrons stumbling onto the street, singing. Socialites attending a gala at the [[Characters/Governor Ritam al’Malklaith|Governor]]’s mansion.
