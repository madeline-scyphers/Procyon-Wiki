[[Factions/The Maelstrom|Factions/The Maelstrom]] pirates have made a station out of derelict freighters, cargo containers, and stolen scrap metal. They call this home “the Cove.” Enterprising individuals can discover where it is located if they have the tenacity or contacts—though it moves about within the Ashtari Cloud. Only the best friends of pirates might be granted storm drives to better navigate with.

Special Rule

Conflicts at the Cove are rampant, but by Banshee’s decree no murder is allowed. Those needing to settle blood feuds resort to kidnapping and killing folks outside the Cloud.

Quick bets taken on an open brawl between two captains over slights. Bluewhite sparks of maintenance workers welding on a new ship. Fresh water misting over rows of hydroponics. A station-wide broadcast of the Banshee’s latest conquest, followed by cheers throughout the halls.
