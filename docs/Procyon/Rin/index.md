The entry point to the [[../index|index]] sector, Rin was colonized a little over a hundred years ago by House Nim-Amar. It has never been an important sector, so Malklaith’s never invested more than a minimum of resources in its development. Instead, it’s used to train young House members, or as an assignment to punish those who fail the House. Galactic law is more present here than the rest of the sector, as this is the seat of the sector’s administration and contains gates to three systems, including a path towards the rest of the Hegemony.

# Notable Places

## Alpeh 

Between the poisonous gases and tectonic instability, Aleph would be a planet to avoid if it weren’t for its mineral stores. Most of the wealth dug from the planet is taxed heavily by the Governor, leading to frequent unrest with the miners.

---

## Ashtari Cloud

An ancient damaged remnant of a massive Ur ship lies in space, generating an in-system nebula. Within it, normal propulsion is minimal and nav systems dodgy. [[../../Factions/The Maelstrom|The Maelstrom]] pirates figured out how to navigate the cloud, and made their base of operations within its protective shroud.

---

## The Straylight 

The latest fad, the Straylight is an upscale club and cocktail bar where elites can wine and dine. It usually orbits Aleph, though it can move to other planets and moons in the system. Its owner, Chance, runs a tight establishment, but things can sometimes get out of hand.

## Baftoma "The Husk" 

Resource exploitation by the Hegemony is comprehensive, and planets incapable of sustaining life are stripped to the core. Baftoma was once such a planet—now only scaffolding of rock remains, its broken form only used by folks hiding or dodging pursuit.
