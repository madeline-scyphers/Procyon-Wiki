Ancient ice palaces dot the surface of this frozen planet, but the race to which they belong has long since passed. Entry to the palaces has been restricted after a string of mysterious explorer deaths. Orbital mirrors shine like artificial suns, keeping a few larger settlements warm and powering large mining rigs for extracting water and liquefied gases.

Special Rule

When you explore the ice palaces of Lithios, you must make a resolve resist if you don’t want to heed the echoes urging you to wander into the frozen wastes alone.

A purple and green aurora shining over the freezing cold sky. Ice explorers whispering about the [Yaru](../../Factions/Yaru.md) creche. Heated vapors escaping around Solitude Colony. Colonists in full parkas, riding large, many-eyed canids. Farmers pulling gas-eels and ice-mushroom wine crates in sail-sporting snow skimmers.
