Over 25 percent of all goods manufactured in the [[Procyon|Procyon]] Sector come from this incredibly industrialized planet. Thick, rust-colored clouds create dusk even during the day. From the warehouse-surrounded spaceport of Reves, one can view the impressive skyline of smokestacks and flames from gas burn-offs. Travel without protective gear is not advised.

Special Rule

The factories have caused massive air pollution; anyone spending any amount of time outside without proper equipment or xeno abilities gains level 2 harm “Indri Lung.”
