With a lush biome, this planet has become well known for pharmaceuticals research and manufacturing. Many regions of the planet are well tended, and due to the comprehensive attentions of the Guild, the garden city of Rost is in perennial bloom. Warm, gentle rains come frequently. The deep forests hide some pirate lairs and Mendicant temples amid overgrown ruins.

Special Rule

While it’s ruined and unsanctified, the [[Factions/Mendicants|Factions/Mendicants]] keep their temple and their mystics tend to any and all that request aid. Take +1d when you recover in their care.

# Vibe

Massive, person-sized flowers blooming along a vinesupported path through the trees. The sweet smell of honey in the air. Scientists having lunch at treetop cafés while reviewing project schedules. Sick pilgrims praying for a cure while waiting to travel to the old Mendicant temple deep in the forests.
