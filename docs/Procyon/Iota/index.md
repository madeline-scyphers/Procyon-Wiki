The planets in Iota orbit a pair of stars—a yellow sun (Iota-1) and a brown dwarf (Iota-2). By the time the Hegemony arrived, there were two asteroid belts, one of which still has a large portion of a shattered planet remaining in its midst. Although both the belts were clearly planets once upon a time, nobody is sure what sort of calamity shattered them. As is their wont, the Guilds didn’t look a gift horse in the mouth—they set up the Iota shipyards, which service many ships in the sector using metals from the belts.

# Notable Places

---

## Shipyards 

While the primary yard is run by Starsmiths, many smaller, licensed hubs work on repairs and ship refits. These stations are full of bored spacers looking for any distraction from the wait. Starsmiths sometimes hire foolhardy pilots for prototype tests.

---

## Belt of Fire 

The region of superheated plasma currents between the Iota binary stars. Spacers spin yarns about the Old Dragon—a vast space creature living there. While the name is whimsical, the Hegemony issued a Quarantine order for the area after several ships disappeared.

---

## Way Line 

The Iota gates produce a region between them where engines have more thrust, akin to “winds” of a planet. The path is hard to find and switches direction. Pilots in the know use this to gain an advantage on rush deliveries (or daring escapes).

## ZX-1138 

long-period comet has recently diverged from its course, taking it much closer to [[../../../Indri|Indri]]. Reasons for the course change are unclear, but locals have requested the Governor investigate. Mystics claim that this has shifted the system Way lines, making the Way sometimes act unpredictably.
