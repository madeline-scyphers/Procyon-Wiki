Sectors in the Hegemony are slices of the galaxy, each controlled by a Noble House overseeing the harvesting of resources and expansion in the area on behalf of the Hegemon. Originally belonging to House Nim-Amar, the sector has changed hands a number of times, finally falling to [House Malklaith](../Factions/House%20Malklaith.md) after the last Hegemon ascended.  
Procyon is a relatively small sector of known space, hosting gates to only four systems (although many say that if the Hantu gate were ever to be open and stable, it would create another boom era for the sector and whichever House was holding it at the time). When Malklaith was promised a sector for their help in the Ascension wars, the “gift” of Procyon was actually an insult. Already mined out, with few directions left for expansion, and too many jumps from the Core, this sector is a washed-out backwater at best. Consequently, people assigned here are sent largely as punishment, or (continuing the Hegemonic tradition) as a way to keep a promise of a posting without giving up something cherished.  
The sector is a burgeoning place for Syndicates, mystics, and other folks that live on the fringes. Too far and too small to have the strong arm of the Hegemony truly clutched around its throat, Procyon is also a hotbed of corruption, peppered with strange temples and Ur remnants that haven’t been picked completely clean. It provides homes for those that may be fleeing the burning light of civilization that emanates from the Core, and opportunities for folks that thrive in the black.
