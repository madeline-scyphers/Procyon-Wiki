Sectors in the Hegemony are slices of the galaxy, each controlled by a Noble House overseeing the harvesting of resources and expansion in the area on behalf of the Hegemon. Originally belonging to House Nim-Amar, the sector has changed hands a number of times, finally falling to [[Factions/House Malklaith|Factions/House Malklaith]] after the last Hegemon ascended.
Procyon is a relatively small sector of known space, hosting gates to only four systems (although many say that if the Hantu gate were ever to be open and stable, it would create another boom era for the sector and whichever House was holding it at the time). When Malklaith was promised a sector for their help in the Ascension wars, the “gift” of Procyon was actually an insult. Already mined out, with few directions left for expansion, and too many jumps from the Core, this sector is a washed-out backwater at best. Consequently, people assigned here are sent largely as punishment, or (continuing the Hegemonic tradition) as a way to keep a promise of a posting without giving up something cherished.
The sector is a burgeoning place for Syndicates, mystics, and other folks that live on the fringes. Too far and too small to have the strong arm of the Hegemony truly clutched around its throat, Procyon is also a hotbed of corruption, peppered with strange temples and Ur remnants that haven’t been picked completely clean. It provides homes for those that may be fleeing the burning light of civilization that emanates from the Core, and opportunities for folks that thrive in the black.

| [[Procyon/Brekk.md\|Brekk]] | The cultural capitol of Procyon. If you’re looking to file paperwork, strike deals, and otherwise mingle with the elite of the sector, you’ll find many of them on the neon-lit streets of [[Procyon/Brekk/Nightfall|Procyon/Brekk/Nightfall]] also sports an untamed, largely unexplored jungle world that can hide those fleeing the law, and entice the rich on hunts for dangerous beasts. |
| [[Procyon/Holt.md\|Holt]]   | Holt has the most Ur influence still and a temperamental Ur gate to an unknown part of space. Holt also has the largest population from before the Hegemony.                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| [[Procyon/Iota.md\|Iota]]   | Iota is the main industrial system in the sector. Between the shipyards, [[Procyon/Iota/Amerath\|Amerath]]'s pharmaceuticals research and production, and [[Procyon/Iota/Indri\|Indri]]'s factories, a plurality of goods/ships/medicine/etc are produced in Iota.                                                                                                     |
| [[Procyon/Rin.md\|Rin]]     | The entry point to the [[Procyon|Procyon]] sector. Simultaneously the seat of The [[Characters/Governor Ritam al’Malklaith\|Governor]] as well as a hot bed of crime and a forgotten home of the poor.                                                                                                                                                                         |
