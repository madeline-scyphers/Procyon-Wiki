Holt was the second [[Procyon|Procyon]] system to be colonized, though the [[Rin|Rin]] Holt gate was troublesome to stabilize. Hegemonic scientists eventually found a series of Ur keys in the system that forced the gate to consistently lead to Holt. The gate remains temperamental, however, and has been known to open on its own. No ships have come through during these spontaneous openings—so far. The Holt system star burns white, though it is far older than stars of this type should be, which Hegemonic scientists attribute to ancient Ur manipulation. Because of Holt's influence from the Ur, or the continual belief in [[The Way|The Way]], or whatever it is, whenever in Holt anything can happen.

Because the Holt gate remains temperamental, the population ([[Lonalowda|Lonalowda]]) from before the Hegemonic empire remains strong there, causing frequent rebellion, and workplace problems.

# Notable Places

---

## Jerec's Junkyard

A free-floating mass of ships and parts, connected via magnetism and cabling. If you’re looking for equipment on the cheap, the Junkyard is your place, though it will likely be missing a piece or unreliable. Jerec also buys, but is a canny haggler.

---

## Hantu Gate

The Hegemony has never been able to activate this jumpgate. Compared to other jumpgates it seems to be missing a few small but key pieces. It has been speculated that the Ur locked the gate and hid the keys somewhere, though it’s anyone’s guess as to why.

---

## Trade Platform Auto #4

The Guild set up an automated platform for selling fuel, covered in defensive systems to deter theft. Because of this, some parties conduct negotiations here to discourage escalation. Nobody knows what happened to the first three platforms.

---

## Planet Omega

Three survey crews and one military expedition vanished before the Legion quarantined this planet. It’s overrun by a deadly life form that nests withing Ur ruins and can resist nukes from orbit. The Hegemony considers it hostile, but insignificant to its plans.
