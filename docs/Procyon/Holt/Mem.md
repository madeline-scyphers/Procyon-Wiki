This ocean planet was colonized by the Hegemony for almost a hundred years before aquatic xenos made themselves (and their planetary claims) known. Hegemonic forces broke the Memish military and incorporated them into the Hegemony. Exploration of Mem has proven difficult because of the free-standing gravity wells deep beneath the waves.

Special Rule

The deeps are littered with Ur sites and strange glows. When in the deeps, using attune for long-term projects grants +1d. Low rolls may attract dangerous Way attention.

Tourists embarking on submersibles to take in the local sea life. Scientists in exo-suits on deep-sea missions while the Memish watch from the waters.
