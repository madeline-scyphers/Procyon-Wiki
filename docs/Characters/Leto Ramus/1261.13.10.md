I see myself on a strange world, in a city I have never been before. 16 moons, more than [[Procyon/Brekk/Nightfall|Nightfall]]. I am chasing someone, I don't know who. The pursuit unfolds under a canopy of the neon city lights, each flicker illuminating the chase with surreal clarity. The air is heavy with the scent of rain on concrete, mingled with the urban decay of exhaust, alcohol, and the unmistakable scent of vomit nearby.

The sound of rain blends with the distant hum of city life, a backdrop to the desperate flight through crowded streets. The indifference of the city's inhabitants only heightens the tension, their faces blurring into the night as they step aside, uninvolved and uncaring.

As the chase leads into the oppressive confines of an old building, the atmosphere shifts. The maze of corridors twists and turns, echoing with the sound of our footsteps, until finally, the man is cornered. The moment is charged with an intensity that seems to freeze time itself.

My arms raise, driven by a force that feels both alien and inevitable, the culmination of the chase hanging in the balance. At this moment, I see my arm glittering in the light of the moons, cold and metallic, driven by someone else before waking up.
