This verdant jungle world would be more settled, were it not for the incredibly hostile natural life. Between rapidly spreading carnivorous plants, seasonally rampaging beasts, and hyper-aggressive fish, only a few distinct types visit Aketi— researchers, poachers, and criminals hiding from the law. The planet is labeled a Malklaith “nature preserve.”

Special Rule

Nobody comes here who doesn’t have to. The planet hates you, and jobs are hard to find. Even bounty hunters pass it by. When you lay low on Aketi, take +1d.
